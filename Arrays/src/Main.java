//        if memory is allocated in the run time then it is said as dynamic memory.
//        array objects are stored in HEAPs
//        heap objects are not continuous.
//        Dynamic memory allocation.
//        Hence arrays in java may not be continued while c and c++ does.
//        depends on jvm.
//        new is used to create an object in the syntax.
//        in an INT empty array it returns the the value 0. where as for string it returns null.
